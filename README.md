# `Citi Bike` : Demographics of bikers in NYC

Based on the data provided by __Citi Bike__, some questions such as:
- Where do Citi Bikers ride? 
- When do they ride (Peak times per station)?
- How far do they go? 
- Which stations are most popular? 
- What factors are influenced by biker's ages?

With the help of `Tableau Public`, a dashboard has been built to provide answers to business questions which are most relevant to decision makers.
